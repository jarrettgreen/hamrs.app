I know it's too late for this years WFD, but I spent my time on during WFD getting the template right, and also work on refactoring the code to make adding templates in the future much easier. If there is a template you'd like to see, let me know over on [the community site](https://community.hamrs.app/c/feature-requests/6)

**What's coming next?**

* Translations! This has been requested by a few users and it's easy to achieve with their help! If you'd like to help let me know over on [the community site](https://community.hamrs.app/c/feature-requests/translations/8)
* QSO Table Searching
* I'm not sure, hit me up with requests! I'd love to start working on a Field Day template in time for June.
