Thank you to all of the folks taking a part in the iOS beta test phase. I'm happy to be able to implement a couple of your suggestions with this release, as well as do a little housekeeping:

**Quick Changelog**

* **FEATURE:** Added ability to create multiple station profiles and switch between them while in the Logger
* **FEATURE:** After entering a callsign in a form, a toast will appear with Station Information
* **FEATURE:** POTA form persists park name, freq, band, and mode between sessions
* **BUGFIX:** Duplicate entires are only marked if if callsign, mode, and date match
* **BUGFIX:** POTA form populates 'POTA' in the `my_sig` field when exporting ADI file
