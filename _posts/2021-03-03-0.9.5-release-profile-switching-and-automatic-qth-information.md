Thank you to all of the folks taking a part in the iOS beta test phase.If you'd like to join, [please fill out this form](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/8N3CPPL).

I'm very happy to be able to implement a couple of your suggestions with this release, as well as do a little housekeeping:

**Quick Changelog**

* **New Features**
  * Added ability to create multiple station profiles and switch between them while in the Logger
  * After entering a callsign in a form, a toast will appear with Station Information
  * POTA form persists park name, freq, band, and mode between sessions
* **Bug Fixes**
  * Duplicate entries are now only marked if the callsign, mode, and date match (Thanks, CU3HY!)
  * POTA form now populates 'POTA' in the `my_sig` field when exporting ADI file

**Instant QTH Information**

Typing a callsign into the filed and pressing tab, or moving to another field will immediately query QRZ to let you know who you're contacting. Thanks to KD2E the suggestion!

**Profile Switching**

You can now create multiple station profiles, and switch between them while in a log. Thanks to W8ATM for the suggestion!
